## Creating and Sharing Strategies

### Strategy Development
Strategies are implemented as plugins that can be loaded into the sniper-rs framework. Here's a basic example:

```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use async_trait::async_trait;
use serde_json::Value;
use sniper_plugin::{Strategy, PluginMetadata};

pub struct MyStrategy {
    metadata: PluginMetadata,
}

#[async_trait]
impl Strategy for MyStrategy {
    async fn generate_plan(&self, signal: &Value) -> Result<Option<Value>> {
        // Your strategy logic here
        Ok(Some(serde_json::json!({
            "action": "buy",
            "amount": "1000000000000000000", // 1 ETH in wei
            "token_in": "ETH",
            "token_out": "USDC"
        })))
    }
    
    fn metadata(&self) -> &PluginMetadata {
        &self.metadata
    }
}
```

### Publishing to the Marketplace
1. Package your strategy as a crate
2. Upload it to the marketplace service
3. Include documentation and examples
4. Add tags for discoverability

## Building Plugins

### Plugin Types
1. **Signal Processors** - Filter and enhance incoming trading signals
2. **Strategies** - Generate trade plans from signals
3. **Risk Assessors** - Evaluate risk for trade plans
4. **Executors** - Execute trade plans on exchanges

### Plugin Architecture
Plugins implement traits defined in the `sniper-plugin` crate. Each plugin must provide:
- Metadata (name, version, description, etc.)
- Implementation of the appropriate trait
- Configuration schema (optional)

### Example Plugin
See `crates/sniper-plugin/examples/simple_signal_processor.rs` for a complete example.

### Plugin Distribution
Plugins can be:
1. Published to the community marketplace
2. Shared as GitHub repositories
3. Distributed as compiled binaries
