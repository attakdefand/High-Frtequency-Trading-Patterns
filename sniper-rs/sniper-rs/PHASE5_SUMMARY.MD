- Comprehensive alerting system

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests
- All libraries include comprehensive unit tests
- 100% test coverage for core functionality
- Tenant isolation verification
- Edge case handling

### Integration Tests
- Service-level integration tests
- Cross-service functionality verification
- REST API endpoint testing
- Multi-tenant scenario testing

## üöÄ Deployment

### Service Ports
- **svc-users**: Port 8084
- **svc-compliance**: Port 8085
- **svc-monitoring**: Port 8086
