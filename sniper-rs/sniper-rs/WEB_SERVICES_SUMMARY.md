# Web Services Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation and testing of the web-based services for the sniper-rs project.

## Implemented Services

### 1. svc-gateway
- **Purpose**: Main HTTP API Gateway for the sniper-rs system
- **Port**: 3000 (default)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
  - `POST /signals` - Create and publish signals to the message bus

### 2. svc-portfolio
- **Purpose**: REST API for portfolio management
- **Port**: 8080 (default)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
  - `GET /positions` - Get all positions
  - `POST /positions` - Create a new position
  - `GET /positions/:id` - Get a specific position
  - `PUT /positions/:id` - Update an existing position
  - `DELETE /positions/:id` - Close a position
  - `GET /metrics` - Get portfolio performance metrics
  - `POST /plan` - Generate a trade plan

### 3. svc-orders
- **Purpose**: REST API for advanced order types
- **Port**: 8081 (default)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
  - `GET /orders` - Get all orders
  - `POST /orders` - Create a new order
  - `GET /orders/:id` - Get a specific order
  - `PUT /orders/:id` - Update an existing order
  - `DELETE /orders/:id` - Cancel an order
  - `GET /orders/:id/status` - Get order status
  - `GET /orders/:id/plan` - Generate trade plan for an order

## Technologies Used

- **Web Framework**: Axum (Rust web framework)
- **Serialization**: Serde for JSON serialization/deserialization
- **CLI Parsing**: Clap for command-line argument parsing
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio for asynchronous operations
- **Logging**: Tracing for structured logging

## Testing Results

All three web services have been successfully tested with the following results:

### svc-gateway
- ✅ Health check endpoint returns 200 OK with service status
- ✅ Signal creation endpoint successfully creates and publishes signals

### svc-portfolio
- ✅ Health check endpoint returns 200 OK with service status
- ✅ Position creation endpoint successfully creates positions (with proper size limits)
- ✅ Position management endpoints work correctly

### svc-orders
- ✅ Health check endpoint returns 200 OK with service status
- ✅ Order creation endpoint successfully creates orders with various order types
- ✅ Order management endpoints work correctly

## Usage Examples

### Starting the services
```bash
# Start gateway service on port 3000
cargo run -p svc-gateway

# Start portfolio service on port 8080
cargo run -p svc-portfolio

# Start orders service on port 8081
cargo run -p svc-orders
```

### Testing with curl (or PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest)
```powershell
# Test gateway health
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:3000/health -Method GET

# Create a signal through gateway
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:3000/signals -Method POST -Body '{"source":"test","kind":"test_signal","chain_name":"ethereum","chain_id":1,"token0":"0xToken0","token1":"0xToken1","extra":{"test":true}}' -ContentType "application/json"

# Test portfolio health
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8080/health -Method GET

# Create a position
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8080/positions -Method POST -Body '{"symbol":"ETH/USDT","chain_id":1,"chain_name":"ethereum","amount":0.1,"entry_price":3000.0,"current_price":3100.0,"side":"long","leverage":2.0}' -ContentType "application/json"

# Test orders health
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8081/health -Method GET

# Create an order
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8081/orders -Method POST -Body '{"symbol":"ETH/USDT","chain_id":1,"chain_name":"ethereum","order_type":"limit","side":"buy","amount":1.0,"price":3000.0,"stop_price":null,"limit_price":null,"trail_percent":null,"visible_amount":null,"total_amount":null,"duration_minutes":null}' -ContentType "application/json"
```

## Integration with Other Services

The web services integrate with the existing sniper-rs ecosystem:

- **svc-gateway** publishes signals to the message bus for consumption by other services
- **svc-portfolio** manages portfolio positions and generates trade plans
- **svc-orders** handles advanced order types and converts them to executable trade plans

All services maintain the same architecture patterns and coding standards as the rest of the sniper-rs project.
