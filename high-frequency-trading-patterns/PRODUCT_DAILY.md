# High-Frequency Trading Patterns - Daily Development Log

## Project Overview
This log tracks the daily progress of implementing 25 high-frequency trading patterns in Rust. Each pattern is implemented as a separate crate in a workspace structure.

## Template Structure
Each pattern follows this structure:
- `simulator.rs` - Market/environment simulation
- `strategy.rs` - Core algorithmic logic
- `risk.rs` - Risk management controls
- `main.rs` - Wiring and execution loop

## Daily Progress Tracking

### Day 1: Project Setup
- Created workspace structure
- Implemented [hft-common](file:///c%3A/Users/RMT/Documents/vscodium/Master-Test-Cases-Rust/high-frequency-trading-patterns/crates/hft-common/src/lib.rs) crate with basic models
- Defined project layout for all 25 patterns
- Created generation script in [noted.md](file:///c%3A/Users/RMT/Documents/vscodium/Master-Test-Cases-Rust/high-frequency-trading-patterns/noted.md)

### Day 2: Documentation
- Created PRODUCT_FEATURES.md
- Created PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md
- Created this PRODUCT_DAILY.md
- Planned implementation approach

### Day 3: Implementation Kickoff

5. Prepare educational materials

## Issues and Resolutions

### Current Issues
- Cargo.toml parsing errors due to duplicate entries
- Module name issues with hyphens in crate names
- Missing tracing-subscriber dependency
- Missing hft-common library target
- Missing source files in hft-common crate

### Resolutions
- Cleaned Cargo.toml file to remove duplicates
- Updated module names from hft-common to hft_common
- Added tracing-subscriber dependency to all pattern crates
- Added lib target to hft-common crate
- Recreated missing source files in hft-common crate
- Successfully built and tested all 25 patterns

## Next Steps
1. Optimize performance of implemented patterns
2. Add more sophisticated strategies to each pattern
3. Expand comprehensive test suite with integration tests
4. Begin documentation of implemented patterns
5. Enhance CI/CD pipeline with additional checks
