- `strategy.rs`: Implements the basic market making logic
- `risk.rs`: Provides fundamental risk controls (position limits, rate limiting)
- `main.rs`: Orchestrates the components and manages the event loop

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `tick_ms`: 1ms (high-frequency tick interval)
- `tick_sz`: 0.01 (minimum price increment)
- `max_pos`: 10,000 (maximum position size)
- `max_orders_s`: 50,000 (maximum orders per second)
