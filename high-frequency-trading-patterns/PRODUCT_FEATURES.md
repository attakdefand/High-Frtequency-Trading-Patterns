# High-Frequency Trading Patterns - Product Features

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Strategy Implementation
- 25 distinct HFT strategies implemented as separate Rust crates
- Modular design allowing individual strategy development and testing
- Common library ([hft-common](file:///c%3A/Users/RMT/Documents/vscodium/Master-Test-Cases-Rust/high-frequency-trading-patterns/crates/hft-common/src/lib.rs)) for shared components and data structures

### 2. Strategy Components
Each strategy crate contains:
- `simulator.rs` - Market simulation environment
- `strategy.rs` - Core algorithmic logic
- `risk.rs` - Risk management controls
- `main.rs` - Entry point and component wiring

### 3. Common Infrastructure
- Shared data models for Quotes, Orders, and Fills
- Configuration management system
- Asynchronous execution using Tokio
- Real-time logging and monitoring with tracing

### 4. Educational Focus
- Clean, well-documented code examples
- Strategy-specific comments explaining logic
- Risk controls demonstrating best practices
- Clear separation of concerns in each pattern
